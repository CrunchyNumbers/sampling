# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The sample quality appears to be well-structured given the use of stratified random sampling.
    This method is beneficial as it ensures representation across various demographics such as provinces, age groups, and genders.
    By segmenting the population into these strata and then randomly sampling within each, the sample is more likely to reflect the diverse views of the entire Canadian electorate.
    This approach helps mitigate sampling bias and enhances the representativeness of the survey results.
    However, the quality of the sample will also depend on the accuracy and completeness of the sampling frame (the list of eligible voters).
    If the sampling frame is outdated or incomplete, some segments of the target population might be underrepresented, potentially affecting the overall representativeness of the sample.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No - while observational studies are useful for gathering data on behaviors and patterns without direct interaction, they do not allow for the direct collection of voter opinions, preferences, and perceptions regarding specific issues or party leadership.
    Surveys are designed to ask targeted questions that directly address the research objectives, enabling the collection of specific insights that are critical for fine-tuning the campaign strategy.
    Observational studies lack this direct feedback mechanism and thus would not provide the detailed, actionable data needed to understand voter preferences and priorities in the context of an election campaign.
    ```
